> Can a team of AI agents accomplish what one AI instance alone cannot?

In this project we are embarking on a grand experiment. The project involves setting up a team of
multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents, such as GPT 3.5 and GPT 4, each with a specific role, to
solve a complex problem under the direction of a human manager. LLM agents are
state-of-the-art natural language processing models that use machine learning techniques to generate
human-like language output and perform various language-related tasks.

The team of LLM agents can consist of agents with different roles, such as agents responsible for
ideation, agents responsible for writing or coding, and agents responsible for editing, feedback,
and revisions. The agents communicate with each other to coordinate their actions towards a common
goal.

A human manager oversees the team's work and provides guidance to ensure the agents are working
efficiently towards the desired outcome. The human manager also directs the conversation, addressing
questions or tasks towards different members of the AI team.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of combining human and machine intelligence to
create a collaborative team that can solve complex language- and coding-related problems efficiently
and effectively.
